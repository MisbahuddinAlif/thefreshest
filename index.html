            <p class="gadaftalk">Use this <a class="calculator" target="blank" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm">calculator</a> Trusted Source to see where you fit on the BMI scale (opens in a new tab).However, keep in mind that there are many problems with the BMI scale, which only looks at weight and height. It does not take muscle mass into account.
                Some people are naturally very skinny but still healthy. Being underweight according to this scale does not necessarily mean that you have a health problem.
                Being underweight is about 2–3 times more common among girls and women, compared to men. In the US, 1% of men and 2.4% of women 20 years and older are underweight.</p>
            <p class="gadaftalk">In comparison, obesity was associated with a 50% greater risk of early death, indicating that being underweight may be even worse for your health (3Trusted Source).Another study found an increased risk of early death in underweight men, but not women, suggesting that being underweight may be worse for men (4Trusted Source).Being underweight can also impair your immune function, raise your risk of infections, lead to osteoporosis and fractures and cause fertility problems (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).What’s more, people who are underweight are much more likely to get sarcopenia (age-related muscle wasting) and may be at greater risk of dementia. </p>

            <h4><p class="tahsin2">There are a lot of dangerous and sick types of people in the world, but someone who sexually assaults children — a pedophile — is probably the worst of the worst. People look down on pedophiles more than other dangerous criminals because children are young, small, and vulnerable. Children need to be protected, not preyed upon. Even in prison — a place full of killers, thieves, and rapists — the other bad guys will usually hurt or even kill a pedophile.</p></h4>
            <h4><p class="tahsin2">In popular usage, the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided, because although some people who commit child sexual abuse are pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children.</p></h4>

Although there are many disadvantages in government jobs but there are many advantages as well which will make you think why you should work in a govt. job.</p></h4>
            <h4><p class="mobastalk">Well! a government job or a sarkari naukri do have many benefits that a private job cannot offer.Whether the country is in great economic depression or milk & honey is flowing on the streets, it does not matter. In both circumstances, you will get your monthly salary on time.</p></h4>
            <h4><p class="mobastalk">However, in a private job a person will get his salary only if company is making profit, when company stops making profit then no salary for employees.</p></h4>
            <h4><p class="mobastalk">Next great thing about a government job is you get pension until you die. This is a complete insurance of your life.In fact no private job gives you pension and you have to either save money while you are working or beg in front of your children.A government employee never has to fear about his future. He or she can retire peacefully without bothering future.This is a main reason why people still love government jobs over private jobs.</p></h4>
